<p>As a summary, Clarity Techwork has give us a very attentive talk. In the talk, they mentioned about the task of every workers including web developer, UI/UX designer, API developer, QA tester and andriod developer. Through their sharing of their experience we have a clearer picture of their job scope. They did mention that the language they often use such as Laravel and Vue so that we can do some research before we find jobs. They also mention the technology that they used such as Andriod Studio to develop mobile application and Firebase Console to monitor user applocaiton crashes and notificaiton.</p>
<p>For the part of reflection, from this industrial talk, I have know the difference between university and work. They did mention and tell us that there are more challenge in the work phase as we need to develop everything according to the reality so that it is useful and user-freindly. Thus, from this point, I know that I need to be aware to the surroundings and the new stuff happens around me so that I can develop some new apps which can solve problems in daily life in the future. Besides, they did mention that communication is important among the staffs. As they mentioned, communication is really important as life now we seldom communicate face to face and will cause some misunderstanding when we do some group projects and assignments. Hence, we would encourage face to face meetings and discussions for the upcoming assignments and projects! </p>
